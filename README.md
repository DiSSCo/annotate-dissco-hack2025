1st DiSSCo Machine Annotation Service Hackathon 
March 24thâ€“26th 2025 


This is the central repository used during the DiSSCo Machine Annotation Service Hackathon

The hackathon is a hands-on event to develop annotation services for digital specimens. The participants will work on extracting and enriching specimen data and integrating their service into the DiSSCover architecture to enhance FAIR data.

### Background 

**What is a Machine Annotation Service?**

A Machine Annotation Service (MAS) is an automated service that annotates a target in DiSSCo. These services are scheduled by users on individual specimen or media in DiSSCo. What a MAS offers is broad. From sophisticated AI services to taxonomic services to linking to other infrastructures, MASs add value to natural science collections data in all sorts of ways.

### Datasets 

Would you like to have a specific dataset ingested into the DiSSCover [sandbox](https://sandbox.dissco.tech/) environment? Only data within the sandbox environment may be annotated by a MAS. Datasets ingested into the sandbox environment are harmonized to the OpenDS specification and are publicly available.

In order to be ingested, data must made available through an endpoint, and it must be either in the Darwin Core or ABCD(EFG) format. If you would like your data ingested, please provide:
- The endpoint your data is available on
- The host organisation (including ROR if possible)
- A brief description of your dataset
